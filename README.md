# PrivacyPatrol

PrivacyPatrol is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and alert users about potential privacy risks on Windows devices. Its primary goal is to ensure the protection of personal information by checking various system configurations and settings.

## Features

- **Firewall Monitoring**: Verifies if the Windows Firewall is enabled across all profiles.
- **Antivirus Status Check**: Confirms if the default antivirus is active.
- **OS Update Check**: Identifies if there are pending system updates.
- **Privacy Settings Check**: Evaluates specific privacy settings like location services.

## Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.x
- Administrator privileges (for accessing certain system configurations)
- PowerShell

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `privacypatrol.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your Windows machine.
3. Open a terminal with administrator privileges.

## Usage

Execute the script using Python:

```bash
python privacypatrol.py
```

The program will perform a series of checks and log the results to a file named `privacy_patrol.log`. It will also print alerts on the console if any privacy risks are detected.

## Logs

PrivacyPatrol maintains a log file (`privacy_patrol.log`) in the same directory as the script, detailing the checks performed and any warnings or errors encountered.

## Disclaimer

PrivacyPatrol performs basic checks and provides alerts based on available system settings. It's recommended to use this tool in conjunction with other security measures to ensure comprehensive protection of personal information.
